**Course Reflection**

What were your initial expectations for the course? Did the course meet,
exceed, or fall short of these expectations?

  | Before the course started, I expected to learn practical skills like setting up servers, configuring networks, and troubleshooting system issues. Thankfully, the course delivered on these expectations. It provided plenty of hands-on experience that not only solidified these skills but also boosted my confidence in tackling real-world tech challenges. |
  | :---------- |


What were the main topics or concepts covered in the course? How did
these topics contribute to your understanding of the subject matter?

  | The course focused on key areas such as installing and configuring operating systems, monitoring server performance, system security, and backup and recovery procedures. These concepts were crucial in giving me a well-rounded understanding of how to effectively manage and safeguard IT systems. |
  | :---------- |

Reflecting on your learning process, what were the most effective
strategies or techniques that helped you grasp and retain the course
material?

  | What really worked for me was hands-on practice—actually doing the tasks, not just reading about them. Taking detailed notes during lectures also helped a lot when it came to revisiting topics. Collaborating with classmates was another big plus. Discussions and group problem-solving made some of the trickier subjects, like security configurations, much easier to grasp. |
  | :---------- |

Were there any particular assignments, projects, or activities that
significantly enhanced your learning experience? Why were they
effective?

  | The most impactful activities were projects like analyzing server performance and mastering basic command-line tools. These assignments were effective because they let me apply the theories in real-world scenarios. Breaking tasks into smaller steps and working through them systematically was super helpful for understanding the material. |
  | :---------- |

Did you encounter any challenges or difficulties during the course? How
did you overcome these obstacles, and what did you learn from them?

  | I hit a few roadblocks, especially with complex topics like service management and creating acceptable use policies. To overcome these, I leaned on additional resources like video tutorials, practice exercises, and discussions with peers. These experiences taught me that persistence and a willingness to seek help are essential for tackling tough topics. |
  | :---------- |

Did the course encourage critical thinking and analysis? How did it
promote higher-order thinking skills, such as problem-solving or
decision-making?

  | The course definitely encouraged critical thinking. It wasn’t just about following instructions—it was about analyzing problems and figuring out the best solutions. Whether it was troubleshooting a server issue or deciding on security protocols, I had plenty of opportunities to sharpen my decision-making skills. |
  | :---------- |

Reflecting on your personal growth, what new knowledge, skills, or
perspectives did you gain from this course?

  | Beyond technical skills, this course gave me a new perspective on problem-solving. I learned how to break down complex tasks into manageable steps and approach challenges methodically. This mindset has made me more confident in handling IT-related issues. |
  | :---------- |

How do you plan to apply what you have learned in this course to your
future studies, career, or personal life?

  | I plan to use these skills in future projects, internships, and eventually in my career. Whether it’s managing servers, troubleshooting systems, or ensuring cybersecurity, the knowledge I’ve gained will be invaluable for staying ahead in the tech field. |
